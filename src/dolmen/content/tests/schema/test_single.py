One schema example
==================

Conan is a simple Barbarian. Thinking is an everyday challenge for him.
While he's not punching camels, he's resting or drinking in a tavern.
Therefore, only one schema can define him pretty good :

  >>> conan = Barbarian()
  >>> IBarbarian.providedBy(conan)
  True

  >>> from dolmen.content.interfaces import IContent
  >>> IContent.providedBy(conan)
  True

Of course, our Barbarian is an IBarbarian but still a IContent.
It still has the title and __content_type__ attributes. It also has the
attributes defined in the IBarbarian interface, set by default.

  >>> conan.nickname
  u'The Barbarian'
  >>> conan.kills
  100
