Multiple schemas example
========================

Sonja The Red is a famous Hero and a Barbarian. She has a certain killing
standard but, all things considered, she's not a savage and she likes fancy
outfits. Two schemas can summarize her killing and fashion tendencies :

  >>> sonja = FemaleBarbarian()
  >>> IBarbarian.providedBy(sonja)
  True
  >>> IFemaleHero.providedBy(sonja)
  True

Sonja is maybe a barbarian, but her Redhair is one of her most priced assets.
So, if defined at the class level, the attribute will not be overriden and
the given value will be used.

  >>> sonja.nickname
  u'The Red'

The other attributes of our hero are still set to default.

  >>> sonja.armor
  u'metal bikini'
