Dolmen Content
==============

Grok is a framework for rapidly developing and deploying rich, 
full featured content types within the context of Zope3 / Grok.

Dolmen Content is based on the idea of schemas, which describes the
structure of your content. In the *grokking* process this schema
is connected to your content type. Factories are used, and also
created automatically during the *grokking process* for you.
