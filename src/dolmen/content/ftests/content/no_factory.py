No factories
============

Sometimes, it makes no sense to have factories for objects, for they are not
destined to be used as a content type. In these case, having a factory is
useless and confusing. Therefore, a nofactory directive allows you to
explicitly mark your component as non-eligible for an auto factory grokking,
even if a factory directive is set on the class.
