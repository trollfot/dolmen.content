One schema example
==================

Conan is a simple Barbarian. Thinking is an everyday challenge for him.
While he's not punching camels, he's resting or drinking in a tavern.
Therefore, only one schema can define him pretty good :

  >>> conan = Barbarian()
  >>> IBarbarian.providedBy(conan)
  True
  >>> dolmen.IBaseContent.providedBy(conan)
  True
 
Of course, our Barbarian is an IBarbarian but still a IBaseContent.
It still has the title and __content_type__ attributes. It also has the
attributes defined in the IBarbarian interface, set by default.

  >>> conan.nickname
  u'The Barbarian'
  >>> conan.kills
  100


Multiple schemas example
========================

Sonja The Red is a famous Hero and a Barbarian. She has a certain killing
standard but, all things considered, she's not a savage and she likes fancy
outfits. Two schemas can summarize her killing and fashion tendencies :

  >>> sonja = FemaleBarbarian()
  >>> IBarbarian.providedBy(sonja)
  True
  >>> IFemaleHero.providedBy(sonja)
  True

Sonja is maybe a barbarian, but her Redhair is one of her most priced assets.
So, if defined at the class level, the attribute will not be overriden and
the given value will be used.

  >>> sonja.nickname
  u'The Red'

The other attributes of our hero are still set to default.

  >>> sonja.armor
  u'metal bikini'
