Changelog
=========

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

* Dependencies have been cut down. `zope.app` packages are no longer
  used. The tests module has been rewritten for a cleaner and clearer
  read.

* Directive `icon` has been removed. The functionality will be
  implemented in a standalone package.

* Directive `schema` now works without grokking, using a
  `zope.interface` class advisor. This allows a flexible
  bootstrapping, even in non-grokked code.

* Using the last `dolmen.field` version with a bug fix.
