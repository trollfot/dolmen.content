Changelog
=========

0.5 (2010-07-13)
----------------

* Default factory now provides a valid `IFactory`
  implementation. Added tests to fix that.

* Changed the policy of the `__content_type__` attribute
  computation. Tests have been added to prevent any changes and
  regression.

* Added an util function to fetch the content type of an object or
  class.

* The `IFactory` interface now allows empty `title` and `description`,
  in accordance with the base value of the generic factory and
  directives.


0.4 (2010-07-13)
----------------

* Factories now provide a name and a description, in addition to the
  title. These attributes, by default, fetch the generated class
  directives' values.

* Updated tests and improved the coverage.

* The factories `name` attribute no longer returns a cooked i18n
  value, but the `name` directive's value of the generated
  class. The form has to take care of its own title now.


0.3.1 (2010-02-22)
------------------

* Corrected a very important bug in the models instanciation. The
  simple instanciation was causing an infinite loop due to imports
  having the same name than the module classes. This is fixed and tests
  have been added to test this simple case and avoid regression.


0.3 (2010-02-08)
----------------

* Using the new `grokcore.content` package, allowing to cut the `grok`
  dependency.

* The `BaseContent` now sets a default `require` value at
  `zope.ManageContent`. This permission is _NOT_ used, it's just a
  convenient directive to implement your own security check.

* Dependencies have been cut down. `zope.app` packages are no longer
  used. The tests module has been rewritten for a cleaner and clearer
  read.

* Directive `icon` has been removed. The functionality will be
  implemented in a standalone package. ATTENTION, this might break
  your existing code !

* Directive `schema` now works without grokking, using a
  `zope.interface` class advisor. This allows a flexible
  bootstrapping, even in non-grokked code.


0.2.2 (2009-09-25)
------------------

* Using the last `dolmen.field` version with a bug fix.


0.2.1 (2009-09-20)
------------------

* Added tests and cleaned the testing module.


0.2 (2009-09-04)
----------------

* Added an OrderedContainer base class.


0.1 (2009-09-01)
----------------

* Initial release
