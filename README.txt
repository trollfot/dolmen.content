Dolmen Content Types Core Package
=================================

About
-----

The package `dolmen.content` is a convenient way to define content
types. Content types usually have several attributes : a type, a
schema, an icon. In addition, they need security to control the
creation, pages to edit them, easy ways to control the display, and
the widgets. This is what provides `dolmen.content`, with an
easy-to-use set of grok directives.


Dolmen
------

Dolmen is a set of tools destined to serve as a rich applications
toolkit. Though, `dolmen.content` is a *standalone* package. It can be
used outside of the Dolmen project.
